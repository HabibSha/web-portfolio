             <h3>Biography</h3>
             <p>This is Habib Shah. I will be turning 21 in 2022. I was born in Cumilla but I grown up in the capital of Bangladesh. I live with my family in Dhaka. I'm a student, I completed intermediate from science group from AKM Rahmatullah university college. I studied Govt. Kalachandpur High School & College, also Bloomfield International School as well as South point school & college. I love to explore and learn new things. I believe that learning comes from inner-self. I'm a quick self-learner. Since my days of School, I've been teaching myself different skills that otherwise would be impossible for my teachers. I'm a student of EEE background.</p>
